          After high school, I began searching for a field to enroll in, After a
          long thought, I decided to enter the field of medical technology,
          because it is the closest field available to microbiology, and at the
          same time I continued improving myself in the field of IT, but after I
          finished my first year of university, I discovered that university
          wasnâ€™t as I expected; since it only focuses on the theoretical aspect,
          and even the practical parts did not satisfy my curiosity.

          After 4 years, the university did not satisfy my passion nor was it
          enough for me to find a suitable job that would provide me with a

          At that time, I started looking for courses and actually finished
          laptop maintenance training and had experience in it, Then I completed
          a technical analysis course for cryptocurrencies, but both of them did
          not feel that I entered the field in which I could be creative. Then
          my friends told me about the code academy and I went with them to an
          event/workshop in the GSG center then I watched how they work together
          with love and how they help and support each other and I watched some
          of their workshops and discussions in meetings and learn to program in
          an interactive and practical way as I have never seen in my university
          nor other courses before, So I searched for the requirements for
          joining the course and studying courses for beginners in learning
          programming, and here we are...
